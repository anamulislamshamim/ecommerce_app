As a security analyst from my security point of view django is very very safe then other backend framework. I have professional certification for MERN development but i found django is very safe in terms of IT security.
I am developing an ecommerce_app with HTML, Tailwind CSS, sqlite and django. 

In this app customer or seller can create account and add their products. Customer can buy any products. For buying customer can message to seller of a particular product and seller can response.

Costomer can search any product by using special keyword like Iphone 15 etc. Also user can search by category like electronics, cloths etc
